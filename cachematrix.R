## two functions 'makeCacheMatrix', 'cacheSolve' help reduce the burden of repeated calculation of matrix inverse 
## by storing the once calculated values into the cache which is available for further use, thus helping 
## in decreasing the amount of time and effort involved in inversion of the same matrix when needed.


## the function 'makeCacheMatrix' takes a  matrix as input and returns the inverse of that matrix and stores it in cache.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    
    inverse_matrix <- NULL ## Initialising and setting the variable 'inverse_matrix'nto 'NULL'
    
    ## values of 'x' and 'inverse_matrix ' are 'set' to other values
    ## in another enevironment (global environment)
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        inverse_matrix <<- NULL
    }
    
    get <- function() x  ## Display the contents of the matrix
    setinverse <- function(solve) inverse_matrix <<- solve ## The inverse of the matrix is calculated using the function 'solve()'
    getinverse <- function() inverse_matrix ##  The values of the 'inverse_matrix' are displayed using 'get'
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setinverse = setinverse,
         getinverse = getinverse)
    ## Inverse of the matrix 'x' is created and stored in the cache for further use
}   


## cacheSolve is a function to find the inverse of a matrix. In case, if inverse of the matrix has already been claculated, 
##it is looked for in the cache and returned
cachSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return the inverse of the given matrix 'x'
    inverse_matrix <- x$getinverse()
    ## checking for the inverse matrix in the cache( if previously inverse was calculated)
    if(!is.null(inverse_matrix)) {
        
        message("getting cached data") ## display this message if inverse of matrix is available in the cache
        return(inverse_matrix) ## return the value of inverse of matrix
    }
    ## The inverse of matrix is calculated if it is not already claculated and the value is not available in the cache
    data <- x$get()  ## elements of the matrix 'x' are read into 'data'
    inverse_matrix <- solve (data, ...) ## using function 'solve()' to carrying out the inversion of the matrix
    x$setInverse(inverse_matrix) 
    inverse_matrix ## inverse of matrix is stored in the variable 'inverse_matrix' is returned
}
